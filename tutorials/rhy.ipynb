    "# Rhythm\n",
    "\n",
    "*mu*s implementation and abstraction of Rhythm is very basic and very direct, but easily extendable. In its current concept *mu* understands rhythm just as a list of floating point numbers where one number represents one duration or delay of an event (in for instance seconds, miliseconds, quarter notes...). The idea of the module is to offer a very general and flexible format for rhythmic notation. It might be related to frequency in the pitch dimension, because every rhythm is representable with floating point numbers but not necessarily very well readable. And like frequency it might be the output format you would send to other programs like [Csound](https://csound.com/) or [Pyo](http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/) to synthesize actual sound files.\n",

    "This Jupyter Notebook shall give you a short overview of the few features *mu* adds to Pythons default floating point type and how you could extend the module for your own usage.\n",
