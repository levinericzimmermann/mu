    "The purpose of *mu*s *sco* - module is to offer different abstractions of musical events. Currently there is only one submodule available, which has been named *old* since it contains mainly Event-Classes that abstract musical events already known in (old) music like Melodies, Cadences, Chordes, etc. \n",
    "*mu*s basic definition of an event is an arbitary object that contains discrete Information about Time and at least one other *mu* - Object. That means a Melody might be an Event, since a Melody contains Information about Pitch and Duration, while a Harmony isn't an Event, since it could only contain Pitch-Objects. On the other hand, a Chord could be an Event Object, since it wouldn't contain only Information about Pitch, but also about its Duration and Volume.\n",

    "*mu* distinguish between *simultan* and *sequential* events. While the first descripes only one distinct event, the sequential events are basically composed through combining different simultan (sub-)events. To initialize any of them, it is obviously necessary to import the module: "
