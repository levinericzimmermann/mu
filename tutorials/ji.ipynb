    "\n",
    "*mu* has a very advanced support of [Just Intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation) through its submodule *mu.mel.ji*. The purpose of this module may range from experimenting with weird, new tunings to educational demonstrations of - let's say a [Pythagorean scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning). The goal of this Jupyter Notebook is to give you a basic overview of how *mu* abstracts Just Intonation and what functionality it offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, it is important to mention that *mu.mel.ji* doesn't make a difference between an interval and a pitch. The difference between both are made through the interpretation of the user. To make this statement clearer, an easy example may help: let's say you have a imaginary, boring scale with only two pitches and what you would like to find out is which interval divides these two pitches. So what you could do in *mu* is just subtracting one pitch from the other. The resulting object will be the interval which divdes them. But in the next step you could just append this resulting interval to your 2-pitch-scale to get a little bit more interesting 3-pitch-scale. In your new interpretation this interval between your two pitches is no longer this interval but a pitch of a 3-pitch scale! If this isn't 100% clear yet, don't worry: I'm sure its getting clearer - step by step - if we look at actual examples.\n",

    "You may have noticed that through adding different intervals, it happens easily that the resulting ratios are higher than an octave (2/1). In classical western music theory octave equivalence is often assumed, which is why it's sometimes helpful to reduce all intervals to an octave. For this case *mu* offers the *normalize* - method. This method expects one argument, which has to be a positive integer. *mu* will interpret this integer *j* as the numerator of a ratio of the form j/1 and it will subtract the concering interval with the j/1 - interval until it is smaller than the j/1 - interval. If the concerning interval is smaller than 1/1 it will also add this interval as often with the j/1 interval until the concerning interval is bigger or equal to 1/1. This means that *normalize(2)* results in scales, which repeat after an octave, while *normalize(3)* may result in scales, which repeat after an octave plus a perfect fifth (an example for such a tuning would be the famous [Bohlen-Pierce-Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohlen%E2%80%93Pierce_scale))."
