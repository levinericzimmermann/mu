    "# Just Intonation\n",
    "\n",
    "*mu* has a very advanced support of [Just Intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation) through its submodule *mu.mel.ji*. The purpose of this module may range from experimenting with weird, new tunings to educational demonstrations of - let's say a [Pythagorean scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning). The goal of this Jupyter Notebook is to give you a basic overview of how *mu* abstracts Just Intonation and what functionality it offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, it is important to mention that *mu.mel.ji* doesn't make a difference between an interval and a pitch. The difference between both are made through the interpretation of the user. To make this statement clearer, an easy example may help: let's say you have a imaginary, boring scale with only two pitches and what you would like to find out is which interval divides these two pitches. So what you could do in *mu* is just subtracting one pitch from the other. The resulting object will be the interval which divdes them. But in the next step you could just append this resulting interval to your 2-pitch-scale to get a little bit more interesting 3-pitch-scale. In your new interpretation this interval between your two pitches is no longer this interval but a pitch of a 3-pitch scale! If this isn't 100% clear yet, don't worry: I'm sure its getting clearer - step by step - if we look at actual examples.\n",

    "You may have noticed that through adding different intervals, it happens easily that the resulting ratios are higher than an octave (2/1). In classical western music theory octave equivalence is often assumed, which is why it's sometimes helpful to reduce all intervals to an octave. For this case *mu* offers the *normalize* - method. This method expects one argument, which has to be a positive integer. *mu* will interpret this integer *j* as the numerator of a ratio of the form j/1 and it will subtract the concering interval with the j/1 - interval until it is smaller than the j/1 - interval. If the concerning interval is smaller than 1/1 it will also add this interval as often with the j/1 interval until the concerning interval is bigger or equal to 1/1. This means that *normalize(2)* results in scales, which repeat after an octave, while *normalize(3)* may result in scales, which repeat after an octave plus a perfect fifth (an example for such a tuning would be the famous [Bohlen-Pierce-Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohlen%E2%80%93Pierce_scale))."

    "Both are helpful to create more complicated *mu* objects. With *mu.sco.old* you could build Melodies (through *JIMel*) and Chords or Cadences (through *JIHarmony*). You could also use them to build scales. Let's try to make the second of [Johann Kirnbergers temperaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirnberger_temperament)! I will follow these (German) [instructions](http://www.wolfgangkostujak.de/downloads/Stimmanweisungen.pdf) by [Wolfgang Kostujak](http://www.wolfgangkostujak.de/downloads/Stimmanweisungen.pdf). The basic idea is to start 3 times at your c4 and to add a couple of just intervals over this c. To archive this, I will make use of the *accumulate* - method of *ji.JIMel*. The idea of this method is to reinterpret pitches as intervals: so while the first element of your *JIMel* - object may be the beginning of your \"Melody\", the remaining elements are the intervals *between two pitches*, meaning that:"

    "Now there is only the a4 missing. While an actual Harpsichord or Piano tuner will tune the a4 by ear in respect to the already tuned e4 and d4 (he will try out to make a compromise between both), *mu* offers some help to find the best solution through math. For this we first have to figure out the perfect interval from d4 and the perfect interval from e4. Afterwards we calculate the distance between both intervals. Unfortunatly we can't just halve the resulting ratio because - like you may know - our ears don't hear pitch linear but logarithmically. Perhaps the best solution would be to use equal distances in terms of factors like it is common in equal temperaments. But then we lose access to many methods which the Just Intonation module of *mu* offers, due to which it might be valuable to find a compromise in Just Intonation. To find this compromise, we can make use of the *halve* - method of *mu*. This method tries to find a pair of two intervals which are as similar as possible and who multiplied result in the halved pitch object."
